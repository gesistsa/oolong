# oolong 0.6.1

* Add fixes for quanteda 4.0.0.

# oolong 0.6.0

* Use seededlda instead of keyATM as demo, so that we can reduce the version requirement.

# oolong 0.5.1

* Transfer ownership to `gesistsa`.
* Add pkgdown website and clean up many documents.

# oolong 0.5.0

* Potential breaking change: the parameter `difficulty` is deprecated. Instead, please use the respective `frewweight` (for STM) and `lambda` (for Warp LDA). For legacy code explicitly using the `difficulty` parameter, this change does not break your code. However, if you use the following pattern, you might need to change your legacy code accordingly.

```r
## This code is okay
set.seed(123)
wsi(abstracts_stm, use_frex_words = TRUE, difficulty = 0.8)

set.seed(123)
## You will get different results with oolong 0.5.0
wsi(abstracts_stm, use_frex_words = TRUE)

## You need to explicitly use the old default, which is quite high
set.seed(123)
wsi(abstracts_stm, use_frex_words = TRUE, frexweight = 1)
```

* The package-level documentation is removed.

* Increase the required R version to 4.0 because of `keyATM`
